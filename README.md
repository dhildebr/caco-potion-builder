# CACO Potion Builder

A web app for planning *Skyrim* potions with kryptopyr's *Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul* installed. Also includes the further ingredients added by *Beyond Skyrim: Bruma* (as patched by TeaBag86) and by *Hunterborn* (as patched in kryptopyr's patch hub). If you ever want to skip the experimentation of finding the perfect combination of ingredients, this app lets you do it from your browser.

- Search for ingredients by name, or show only those with a particular combination of effects.
- Add up to three ingredients to your potion and preview each effect's relative magnitude.
- Include or filter out ingredients added by *Beyond Skyrim: Bruma* and *Hunterborn*.
